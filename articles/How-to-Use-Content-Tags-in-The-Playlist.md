| This feature is only available in OptiSigns' **Pro Plus or above plans.** |

Content tagging in a playlist allows you to better control and customize the playback of your playlist items, enabling you to mix and match content for different screens within the same playlist and greatly simplifying screen management. By using content tags, you can set rules for your screens that determine which tagged assets or sub\-playlists are displayed when your selected playlist is playing. This ensures precise and efficient control over the content displayed on each screen, eliminating the need to create separate playlists for different locations or scenarios.

**Let's jump in and get started:**

In your Playlist settings by clicking on the **Cog** icon \> Selecting **Advanced** \> Click on **Target tags** dropdown menu.

- **Use Playlist Default:** You can create a tag(s) for the entire playlist.
	- *For example, this is useful if you use nested playlists. When setting up rules in the next steps, you can either include or exclude entire playlists based on their tags.*
- **Use Asset Default:** The playlist will follow each individual assets' tags.

## **How to Set Up 'Use Asset Default'**

Create a tag for your desired assets in the Files/Assets page. Follow [**this guide**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056397634-Asset-Tagging-How-does-it-work) to learn more on how to do this.

Add all items to the playlist. Follow [**this guide**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/28295104605843) if you need more information on this step.

In your Playlist settings by clicking on the **Cog** icon \> Selecting **Advanced** \> Select **Use Asset Default** in the **Target tags** dropdown menu.

Then go to **Screens page** \> Click **Edit** on your preferred screen \> Assign your playlist \> Select **Advanced** \> Click on **Content Tag Rule** dropdown menu \> Select **\+ New**.

![Edit Screen Advanced section with the Content Tag Rule dropdown open on New](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/55316969141651)

**Setup** your **Content Tag Rule** for your screen to control which content\-tagged assets or sub\-playlists are displayed when your selected playlist is playing.

**What does inclusion and exclusion rules mean?**

| **Inclusion** | **Exclusion** |
| --- | --- |
| **And:** Will show assets that have all the tags selected. **Or:** Will show any asset with at least one of the tags selected. | **And:** Will **not show** any assets that have all tags selected. **Or:** Will **not show** any asset with at least one of the tags selected. |

- **\+ Rule:** Will add an additional box for you to add more tags.
- **\+Ruleset:** Will create additional rules to attach to your original tag rules.

In this example, any assets **with the location\-a tag** in the selected playlist **will** **display** on this screen. Other assets in this playlist **without location\-a tag will not display** on the screen.

 

## **How to Set Up 'Use Playlist Default'**

When you choose 'Use Playlist Default,' you set a tag for the entire playlist. The assets within the playlist that are set to 'Use Playlist Default' will automatically be tagged with the playlist default tag you set at the playlist level.

| **Note:** These tags do not affect the tags you have placed on your files/assets page. |

Similar to using 'Use Asset Default', if you set your **Content Tag rule** to **include or exclude any assets** with the **same default tag as the playlist** in the selected playlist, then only those assets **will be displayed** on the screen.

Other assets in the playlist **without the same tag** **will not be displayed** on the screen.

| **NOTE** |
| --- |
| Tags are saved in lowercase and turns spaces into hyphens, so Front Lobby is stored as front\-lobby. You don't need to match capitalization; the portal normalizes it for you. |

### **Custom Content Tagging**

If you want a specific asset or nested playlist to have a different tag, follow these steps:

- Select the **asset** or **nested** **playlist** within the current playlist.
- Click the **cog** **icon** next to it.
- Change the Target tag from '**Use** **Playlist** **Default**' to '**Custom**.'
- Input your desired tag in the box below '**Custom**.'

**Example Scenario**

To help illustrate how this feature works, we will use the following simple scenario as an example:

> A hotel has one screen in the lobby and one screen in the back room. There is one global playlist pushed to both screens, but I want to control which assets within the global playlist play on each screen.

| **IMPORTANT NOTE** |
| --- |
| These Content Tag rules **will not**apply to screen Previews. This is because Previews are limited by web browser \- your screen, however, should display properly. |

- **Lobby Display:** Suppose your global playlist is tagged 'front\-lobby' as the Playlist default. All assets within this playlist will be tagged as 'front\-lobby.'

![Playlist Options Target tags set to Use Playlist Default with tag front-lobby](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/55316990928915)

- **Back Room Display:** If you have a specific asset you want to play in the back room within the global playlist, you can tag that asset as 'back\-room'.
- **Edit Screen \> Selective Content Display:**

On the Edit Screen level, you can set your content rule for your Front Lobby screens. In this example, the content tag rule is set to **include** items tagged as **'front\-lobby'**. This way, the screen will only display assets tagged as 'front\-lobby' from your global playlist and ignore any assets or sub\-playlists that do not have the 'front\-lobby' tag. So, anything tagged back\-room will not display.

**![Content Tag Rule named Hotel Demo including the tag front-lobby](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/55316991025171)**

For your screens in the Back Room, you can set your content rule to **include** items tagged as **'back\-room'**. This way, only assets tagged as 'back\-room' from your global playlist will be displayed, and any assets or sub\-playlists that do not have the 'back\-room' tag will be ignored. So, anything tagged front\-lobby will no display.

You also have the option to set an exclusion rule, which will prevent any assets with specific tags from being displayed on the selected screen.

By following these steps, you can efficiently manage and customize tags for playlists and individual assets.

**That's it!**
