## Option 2: Setting Up a Public Sheet

In your Sheet, go to **Files** → **Share** → **Publish this Document** → Click **Publish \-\> OK.**

![Google Sheets Publish to the web dialog with an arrow pointing at the blue Publish button.](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/55559279721747)

| If you do not publish AND share your Sheet, OptiSigns will have you go through the authentication process shown in the previous section. An error message may appear telling you the Sheet isn't published |

**Copy this** **published link** → Return to your Google Sheets app in the OptiSigns portal.

![Publish to the web dialog after publishing, with the published link boxed in red.](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/55559286821139)

## Limitations

- **Update Intervals:**
	- **Private Sheet:**Google will notify our system when you update your Sheet, and we will reload the information in as little as 5 minutes, up to one hour (or whenever you set your Force Sync Interval).
	- **Published Sheet:** Google updates the webpage automatically every 5 minutes. Your screens should then update in around 5\-10 minutes, up to the Force Sync interval (minimum 1 hour).
- **Hidden Sheet:** If you try to import a hidden Sheet, we will not be able to access the content. This will cause the Preview window or Screens to display as black.
- **Custom Display Region:**
	- Currently, it is only supported for Private Sheet.
	- This must be set up during the creation of the asset. Once this is selected for an asset, it cannot be unselected. Or, if you do not select it upon creating the asset, you cannot select it later.
	- If you set up Custom Display Region, you can always adjust the inputted cells and scaling.
